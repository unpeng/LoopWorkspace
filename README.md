## Do Not Use This Branch

This branch is kept for historical reasons. It is not supported and might not be usable with newer versions of Xcode and iOS.

Please refer to the original repository to build Loop Verson 3 (and later): https://github.com/LoopKit/LoopWorkspace

* That is where Loop updates originate. 

* The `main` and `dev` branches for this GitHub username (loopnlearn) fork of LoopWorkspace are manually updated to match LoopKit / LoopWorkspace, but you should not rely on this process.

* The other branches are no longer supported and should not be used.

## History

There was a fork created from LoopKit / LoopWorkspace called ivalkou / LoopWorkspace which was used to create an alternative to Loop version 2, called FreeAPS.

This fork, loopnlearn / LoopWorkspace was created from ivalkou / LoopWorkspace and used to support the FreeAPS version of Loop 2 after support was dropped by the ivalkou GitHub account.

* **FreeAPS is no longer supported and should not be used** 
* Most features people used with FreeAPS are now included in Loop 3 or can be added with customization

Some branches in this repository were configured to add specific customizations for earlier versions of Loop 3. These are no longer needed and are not kept updated. [Customization scripts](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code) are provided instead.

* Branches such as **main_lnl_patches** are out-of-date and should not be used
